There is no licence required to use the 3gpp source code, however the patent licence
for MPEG-2 HE-AAC is required from Via Licencing.

See http://www.3gpp.org/faq/faq_2005_2.htm#A3.8

"3.8    Can I use computer code included with a 3GPP TS to implement a product ?
Yes.  Some 3GPP Technical Specifications include computer code such as ASN.1 or XML (protocols), C language (codecs), ...; and some include test patterns (codecs) for verifying implementations.  These are published to allow users of these TSs to implement real-world products.  No permission is required from 3GPP or its Organizational Partners (OPs) to use this code in the design of products - e.g. to compile the C to implement a codec in machine code.  

Nevertheless, there may be essential IPR involved with such a design, and implementors are obliged to seek licences to use that technology.  See FAQ 3.2."


Also, If AAC+ V2 (Parametric Stereo) is required an additional licence is required from Codingtechnologies.  This is not enabled in our build.
